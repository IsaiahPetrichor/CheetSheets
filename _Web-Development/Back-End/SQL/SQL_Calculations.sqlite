-- count returns the amount of rows in a database
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;

-- sum adds all values within a column
SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- min/max returns the lowest/highest value in a column
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- avg returns the average value in a column
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- round takes an extra parameter of what decimal place you want
SELECT ROUND(AVG(column_name), 2) FROM table_name;
-- this rounds the avg of a column to the second decimal place.

-- GROUP BY organizes data into, well... groups
SELECT category, SUM(usage)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY category;
/* this will display a column with each distinct category as a row
with another category containing the sum of each categories usage */

-- you can shorthand the GROUP BY and ORDER BY commands
SELECT category, SUM(usage)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY 1
-- this will group it by category
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- this will order it from high to low based on SUM(usage)

-- you can also GROUP BY multiple columns

-- you can filter groups using HAVING
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(usage)),

-- the proper order for queries is:
/*
SELECT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
LIMIT
