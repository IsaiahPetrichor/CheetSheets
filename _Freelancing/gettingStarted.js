    1. Administration
        {
            Meet all clerical and legal criteria before even taking a customer // not needed for fiverr and shopify

            Decide if you are a company or a sole-proprietor // unnecessary if you are operating as a sole-proprietor under your legal name

            Keep up on local business requirements // same as above

            Get a business address for your company // simple PO box is all that is needed

            Open a business bank account (requires a IRS EIN for your business) // unnecessary

            Get a business email // operating with a gmail account is fine

            Get accounting software for bookkeeping (wave, quickbooks) // unneeded, simply budget

            Credit Card Processing // processed through fiverr and shopify and upwork.
