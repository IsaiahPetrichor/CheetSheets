    1. Funding operations
        {
            you will be surprised by the amount of expenses that stack up.

            you must be profitable from day 1, losing money for growth is not ok.

            DO NOT go into debt to start a business

            Re-invest your profits and be self funding
        }

    2. Deciding your Niche
        {
            // I've chosen Shopify / eCommerce

            1. Why you need a niche
                {
                    it makes your business more scaleable

                    applicable experience is WAY more valuable than a diverse client base

                    Taking whatever comes in the door becomes a vicious cycle of working more for less money

                    A master of one is better than a master of none
                }
            
            2. Piking a niche
                {
                    something you are interested in and passionate about

                    lean into your skills

                    dont do something you arent excited about, it ends in failure
                }
        }

    3. Figure out what services to offer in the Niche
        {
            1. What services to offer // Customized Shopify Web Apps
                {
                    are you interested in the work? // yes

                    can you scale the service? are there enough customers out there? can you reuse components? // yes and yes

                    can you outsource work from this service? // dont really want to
                }

            2. What do you charge for this service
                {
                    charging a flat fee is much better than charging hourly and it allows you to provide a more refined experience // for shopify this will depend on the project and i will figure it out as I go

                    add recurring revenue, offer app hosting, etc. // Shopify subscriptions end up adding some revenue
                }
        }

    4. Forming your company
        {
            use a business lawyer to avoid significant legal troubles // unneeded for solo freelancers using a service

            get a business license if needed // not necessary in washington

            think about possibly creating an actual company (LLC) // no thanks
        }
