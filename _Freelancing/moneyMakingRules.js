    1. Understand the amount of money you make is proportionate to the value you provide to customers
        {
            the customer doesn't care about what your technical skills are, they care if you can provide a quality service
            provide additional functionality or quote less money.

            nothing matters except what the customer recieves.

            customers will pay more if you can show them why you can provide more value
        }

    2. Focus on the highest paying activities
        {
            highest paying is about total cost divided by time it takes to complete

            take a smaller project if you can end up with more money per hour
        }

    3. Understand it is a full time job
        {
            Put in the time, you can only get paid if you spend substantial time into your business
            
            Don't wait for customers to come to you. if you have 40 hours a week and only 15 hours of work to do, you now have 25 hours to market and find more customers
        }
