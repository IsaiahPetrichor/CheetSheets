/*
	Breadth-First Traversal
	breadth-first iterates through the whole graph in layers by going down one layer, 
	which comprises the start vertexâ€™s direct neighbors. Then it proceeds down to 
	the next layer which consists of all the vertices that are neighbors of the 
	vertices in the previous layer.

// Example
const breadthFirstTraversal = (adj, V) => {
	// V is the start vertex
	// adj is an adjacency list represented by a 2D array

	// array holding visited verticies
	const visited = new Set([V]);

	// make a queue
	const queue = [V];
	console.log(V);

	while (queue.length > 0) {
		const current = queue.shift();

		adj[current].forEach((neighbor) => {
			const number = Number(neighbor);
